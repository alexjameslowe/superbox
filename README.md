## Superbox CSS

More notes to follow. This is a framework of CSS I've been building gradually over a few years. It's based on flexbox. It follows the idea that you typically don't care about all the myriad options that CSS gives you, you just want boxes that fill horizontal or vertical space without leaving ugly gaps. You want boxes that will take up space greedily, frugally, explicitly, or uniformly. s

Using flexbox means that this is primarily content-driven, which is to say that your layouts will respond to the contents that you give them, and size themselves accordingly, as opposed to a grid-based layout which gives your content hard walls. This framework can be used to create a grid-like layouts as well, the tradeoff being that you have more elements than you would with grid layout, but it's a tradeoff I find to be mostly ok.
